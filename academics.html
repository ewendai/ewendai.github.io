    			</ul>
    			This semester went pretty well. In Stat 20, we completed a group project in analyzing data on World Happiness (more information on "Projects" page). At the end of CS 170, we attempted to come up with an approximation solution to an NP-Hard problem. Math 110 was a bit of a bumpy road: I did well on the first midterm, failed the second midterm, but saved myself by doing extremely well on the final (which took many nights of studying, but worth it).

    		<h3> Summer 2018 </h3>
    		<div id="details">
    			<ul>
    				<li>Math 128A: Numerical Analysis</li>
    			</ul>
    			In Math 128A, we did 2 fairly small projects that were basically coding what we learned in class in Matlab. Looking back, I should have enrolled in more than one class, or signed up for more, as I had much more free time than I knew what to do . . . so I learned some life skills, like cooking. Not that I'm any good at it, but I would say that I can survive. 
                Over the summer, I considered what type of career I would enjoy in the future and the type of skills relevant to it. I decided that I am interested in working towards being a Data Scientist, as it allows me to combine my interest in working with applied mathematics while still utilizing the unendingly helpful tool that is the computer. Therefore, I decided to, once again, change my majors to Data Science and Statistics, as I felt that these two majors very nicely compliment each other.

    		<h3> Spring 2018 </h3>
    		<div id="details">
    			<ul>
    				<li>CompSci 61B: Data Structures</li>
    				<li>CompSci 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</li>
    				<li>Music 25: Introduction to Music Theory</li>
    			</ul>
    			I really enjoyed CompSci 70 and the beauty of logic and mathematics: everything just fits together so nicely and so perfectly. While taking CompSci 61B, however, I realized that I did not want to pursue a Computer Science major. While coding and completing projects are fun (sometimes!), they do not grant me the same satisfaction that working with numbers does. This is why at this point in my academic career I've decided to switch to doubling in Data Science and Applied Mathematics.
                Additionally, this semester I took a lesson on biting off more than I can chew in stretching myself too thin and trying to get involved in everything I am interested.

    		<h3> Fall 2017 </h3>
    		<div id="details">
    			<ul>
    				<li>Math 53: Multivariable Calculus</li>
    				<li>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</li>
    				<li>CompSci 61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
    				<li>EPS C82: Oceans</li>
    			</ul>
    			This was the first semester at uni! I entered with the intention of doubling in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics because I did not yet have a career path in mind; however, I knew that the skills relevant to these majors are highly sought after in a wide variety of fields. I started my university career with 2 Math courses, a CompSci course, and a breadth. I have to say, these classes were all structures quite differently from the way classes are in high school, especially with the amount of professor-student interactions, though that might also have something to do with how BIG of a school UC Berkeley is . . .
